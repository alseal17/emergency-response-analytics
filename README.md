# emergency-response-analytics
## Overview: 

This porject analyzes emergency 911 call data to uncover operational demand patterns, identify peak response periods, and build predictive models for high-load intervals. The goal is to demonstrate applied data science techniques in a public safety context. 

## Objectives: 

-Identify temporal demand patterns 

-Analyze geographic call distribution 

-Engineer operational features from raw timestamps

-Build predictive models for high-demand periods

-Translate findings into actionable operational insights 


## Technologies Used:

-Python

-Pandas

-NumPy

-Matplotlib/ Seaborn

-Scikit-learn

-Jupyter Notebook
